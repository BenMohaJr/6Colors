# 6 Colors

## Description

This project is a game developed as part of a college project using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) graphic library. The game features a customizable board filled with various shapes, including hexagons, and involves a strategic color dominance concept. The objective is to reach 50 percent color ownership on the board to win the game.

## Features

- Customizable board: The game allows the addition of various shapes, not limited to hexagons, through the use of templates. This provides flexibility in expanding the game with different shapes in the future.

- Color dominance gameplay: Players take turns selecting colors to gain control over regions on the board. The goal is to achieve 50 percent color ownership before the opponent does.

- State design pattern: The State design pattern is implemented to manage the game's different states, such as menu, gameplay, and game over screens. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and improves code maintainability.

## Dependencies

- SFML: The game utilizes the SFML graphic library for rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing audio. Make sure to have SFML properly installed and configured.
